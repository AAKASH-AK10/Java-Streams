## ðŸ“Œ Java Streams & Related Concepts â€“ Synopsis

### ðŸ”¹ Core Stream Concepts (Java 8)
- Stream basics â€“ operations on collections in a functional style.  
- Stream vs Collection â€“ stream is one-time-use, lazy, declarative.  
- Intermediate & Terminal operations.  
- flatMap, flatMapToInt, flatMapToLong, flatMapToDouble â€“ flattening nested structures (lists of lists, arrays inside lists).  

### ðŸ”¹ Specialized Streams
- IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream â€“ primitive specializations for performance.  
- Creation: mapToInt, IntStream.of(), IntStream.range().  
- Specialized operations: sum(), average(), summaryStatistics().  

### ðŸ”¹ Reduction Operations
- reduce() â€“ combines elements into one result using identity + accumulator.  
- reducing() â€“ collector version of reduce(), mainly used with groupingBy() or partitioningBy().  
- Difference between reduce and reducing explained.  

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Collectors
- Collectors.toList(), toSet(), toCollection()  
- joining() â€“ concatenates strings with delimiter.  
- summarizingDouble() & summaryStatistics() â€“ statistics like count, min, max, avg, sum.  
- partitioningBy() â€“ divides into 2 groups (true/false).  
- groupingBy() â€“ groups elements into multiple groups by classifier function.  
- mapping() â€“ transforms values inside grouping.  
- reducing() â€“ custom reduction inside collectors.
